At some point time in time i need to acknowledge that enough is enough and that it is time to do some brain rotting
So from this point and onwards I am going to make a fun little brain rot project video

Time to make OpenBrainRot but in python

1. Groq API (To convert the text into audio)
2. Beautiful Soup (Simple webscraping for the reddit script)
3. Assets for minecraft parkour (probably like 5 videos will do)
4. Some stupid voice over (possibly for barack obama)
5. Synchronising the subtitles together with the audio (this is possibly the hardest but can be done with Coqui TTS)


In the future: 
1. Create a simple automation platform (most likely need to connect Gemini API => searching for the most up to snazzy brain rots available)



a short and simple plan
reddit_url => generate the video


How? 

Fns:
1. Audio of your choosing (or whatever that I will include probably like)
1. 20 seconds of kanye
2. 20 seconds of lebron james 
3. 20 seconds of Vince mcmahon
4. 20 seconds of Donald Trump

reddit_url => scrape for the texts => pre process force alignment => take oof.txt and get trump to say it =>
then do force alignment
