TITLE
CAN'T
STOP
THINKING
OF
GIRL
FROM
HIGH-SCHOOL
FROM
THIRTIETH
YEARS
AGO
DESCRIPTION
I
KNOW
THIS
CAN
SOUND
PATHETIC
BUT
I
CAN'T
STOP
THINKING
OF
THIS
WOMAN
HEATHER
THAT
I
WENT
TO
HIGH-SCHOOL
WITH
FOR
CONTEXT
WE
GRADUATED
IN
ONE
THOUSAND
NINE
HUNDRED
AND
NINETY
THIRD
FROM
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
SAW
HER
WHEN
HER
FAMILY
MOVED
HERE
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
WE
WERE
IN
SEVENTH
GRADE
I
WAS
IN
LOVE
AT
FIRST
SITE
FOR
YEARS
WE
WOULD
TALK
AS
FRIENDS
THEN
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
ELEVENTH
GRADE
I
HAD
MY
LICENSE
AND
WAS
DRIVING
HER
TO
SCHOOL
EVERY
DAY
HALF
WAY
THROUGH
THE
YEAR
I
FINALLY
GREW
SOME
BALLS
AND
ASKED
HER
ON
THE
WAY
TO
SCHOOL
IF
I
COULD
GET
HER
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
WOULD
SHE
SPEND
THE
DAY
WITH
ME
TO
MY
SURPRISE
SHE
SAID
YES
WE
WENT
FOR
A
WALK
IN
THE
LOCAL
METRO
PARKS
WENT
BOWLING
WENT
AND
SAW
THE
MOVIE
BODYGUARD
AND
WENT
TO
THE
LOCAL
PIZZA
PLACE
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
DAY
OF
MY
LIFE
HER
SMILE
AND
EYES
MADE
MY
STOMACH
FLURRY
WITH
BUTTERFLIES
I
WAS
CHICKEN
AND
DID
NOT
TRY
TO
KISS
HER
WE
HAD
DIFFERENT
FRIEND
GROUPS
AND
DIDN'T
HANG
OUT
BESIDES
THAT
DAY
WE
ENDED
UP
DITCHING
SCHOOL
THIRD
MORE
TIMES
AND
HAD
TONS
OF
FUN
STILL
BEING
A
CHICKEN
I
NEVER
TRIED
TO
KISS
HER
OR
TELL
HER
MY
FEELINGS
WE
STARTED
TALKING
ON
THE
PHONE
WHICH
WAS
ON
A
LANDLINE
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NO
CELL
PHONES
I
WAS
ON
TOP
OF
THE
WORLD
THEN
WE
GRADUATED
AND
SHE
WENT
AWAY
TO
COLLEGE
FAR
AWAY
A
PIECE
OF
ME
DIED
A
LITTLE
WE
LOST
CONTACT
UGH
DON'T
GET
ME
WRONG
I
MARRIED
A
BEAUTIFUL
LOVING
WOMAN
AND
WE
HAVE
BEEN
MARRIED
TWENTY
EIGHTH
YEARS
AND
HAVE
HAD
SECOND
WONDERFUL
CHILDREN
I
LOVE
MY
WIFE
AND
WOULD
NEVER
CHEAT
ON
HER
ABOUT
SECOND
YEARS
AGO
BY
CHANCE
I
SAW
HEATHER
AT
A
SUBWAY
SANDWICH
SHOP
MY
HEART
DROPPED
SHE
LOOKED
MORE
BEAUTIFUL
NOW
THAN
I
REMEMBERED
SHE
RECOGNIZED
ME
WE
TALKED
FOR
ABOUT
FIFTEENTH
MINUTES
SHE
IS
A
NURSE
MARRIED
WITH
CHILDREN
AND
HAPPY
I
AM
HAPPY
FOR
HER
BUT
I
CAN'T
STOP
THINKING
OF
HER
SMILE
I
CAN'T
STOP
THINKING
ABOUT
WHY
DIDN'T
I
MAKE
A
MOVE
TELL
HER
MY
FEELINGS
WAY
BACK
WHEN
I
AM
LITERALLY
LOOSING
SLEEP
OVER
THIS
I
WISH
I
COULD
STOP
THINKING
ABOUT
HER
I
HAVE
A
GREAT
LIFE
THE
PERFECT
WIFE
YES
I
HAVE
TRIED
THERAPY
EVEN
TRIED
BEING
HYPNOTIZED
BUT
WITH
NO
EFFECT
HELP
